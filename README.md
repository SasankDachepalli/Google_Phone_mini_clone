# Google_Phone_mini_clone
I have created a mini clone for google contacts

This app basically has 3 parts, namely contacts,recents, favourites.

In the contacts you can create new contacts which will be reflected in contacts.
For every contact in the main activity 2, i have added intents for calling, texting, even whatsapp chat for the contact numbers.

Recents are added when we make a call from favourites or frequently visited. Still working for recents.

I have added some screenshots of the app in photos folder
